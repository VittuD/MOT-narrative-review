# MOT-narrative-review
Brief narrative review on various recent approaches that tackle multiple object detection and tracking all in one NN.

## Approaches to MOT

| Approach | Description |
|---|---|
| Transformers | Utilize a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to comprehend the relationships between objects within a video sequence. |
| Graph models | Employ a graph to depict the connections between objects in a video sequence. |
| Attention modules | Implement an attention mechanism to concentrate on the most pertinent features for tracking. |
| Motion models | Leverage a motion model to forecast the location of objects in subsequent frames. |
| Siamese networks | Employ a Siamese network to ascertain the similarity between objects in various frames. |
